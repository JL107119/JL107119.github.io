        <h3>Web Application Programming and Hacking Course Information</h3>

        <p>This course, We will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and
            back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with
            hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid
            potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

        <p>We have Covered various Labs, handson and Hackathons in ths course</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 0</h3>
        <p>This lab is covered in Lecture 2, with preparation homework in Lecture 1. 
            In Part I, you need to set up an Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine on VirtualBox and install software and applications. 
            In Part II, you will clone the course repository and your private repository and complete the git exercises to write the report</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 1</h3>
        <p>During these exercises, I explored the fundamentals of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and how GET and POST requests operate.
            I learned how GET requests typically send data through the URL’s query string, while POST requests send their data in the body of the message. Using Telnet, I manually constructed a GET request, which provided a deep view into how a client communicates directly with a server. 
            Using curl, I made a POST request, seeing how a tool can streamline the process of sending form data to a server. 
            Finally, I used Wireshark to capture and inspect these messages, allowing me to visualize exactly what is exchanged between your computer and the server.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 2</h3>
        <p>After completing this lab, I developed a stronger foundation in front-end web development by working with HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and external APIs.
            In Task 1, I created a basic HTML page that included standard tags, an image of my headshot, and an interactive form.
            I incorporated various JavaScript elements to enhance interactivity: inline JavaScript displayed the current date and time, a script tag displayed a live digital clock, and external JavaScript toggled the visibility of my email.
            In Task 2, I expanded my skills by integrating Ajax for asynchronous data exchange, capturing user input and retrieving responses from a PHP application without reloading the page.
            I styled my page using a combination of inline, internal, and external CSS, gaining insight into how each type affects presentation.
            Finally, I integrated two public Web APIs: one that fetched a random programming joke when the page loaded using jQuery Ajax, and another that used the Fetch API to predict age based on a given name.
            These tasks helped me understand real-world applications of asynchronous requests, event handling, user interaction, and third-party data integration—key skills for modern web development</p>
        <h3>Overview of Hackathon 1</h3>
        <p>This hackathon consisted of multiple hands-on exercises covered in Lectures 7-8, where I performed cross-site scripting attacks on multiple levels to understand the vulnerabilities as well as defense methods.
</p>
        <h3>Overview of Individual Project</h3>
        <p>In this project, I expanded my front-end web development skills by developing a Professional Profile Website and deploying it on github.io cloud service.
            This project has general, non-technical, and technical requirements with grade distributions. </p>
