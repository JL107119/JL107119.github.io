        <h3>Web Application Programming and Hacking Course Information</h3>

        <p>This course, We will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and
            back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with
            hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid
            potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

        <p>We have Covered various Labs, handson and Hackathons in ths course</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 0</h3>
        <p>This lab is covered in Lecture 2, with preparation homework in Lecture 1. 
            In Part I, you need to set up an Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine on VirtualBox and install software and applications. 
            In Part II, you will clone the course repository and your private repository and complete the git exercises to write the report</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 1</h3>
        <p>During these exercises, I explored the fundamentals of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and how GET and POST requests operate.
            I learned how GET requests typically send data through the URLâ€™s query string, while POST requests send their data in the body of the message. Using Telnet, I manually constructed a GET request, which provided a deep view into how a client communicates directly with a server. 
            Using curl, I made a POST request, seeing how a tool can streamline the process of sending form data to a server. 
            Finally, I used Wireshark to capture and inspect these messages, allowing me to visualize exactly what is exchanged between your computer and the server.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 2</h3>
        <p>This Lab is divided into 2 tasks. The part 1 of the lab is to create basic HTML Page with including forms and
            Java Script. While Task 2 involves Ajax, CSS, jQuery and Web API Integration. I have followed the steps
            given in the lecture slides and watched the class recordings to get to know about the lab tasks and have
            done this lab in Virtual Machine with the help of Sublime Text Editor.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Hackathon 1</h3>
        <p>This hackathon consists of multiple hands-on exercises covered in Lectures 7-8, where I would perform
            cross-site scripting attacks on multiple levels to understand the vulnerabilities as well as defense
            methods. I followed the instructions to do the lecture exercises to complete this hacking exercise.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Individual Project</h3>
        <p>This Individual project is to develop a portfolio for myself and to showcase my skills in order to target my
            potential employer. This has been pushed into a public repository. Additionally, apart from the contents of
            my resume, there were additional tasks given by professor that were already covered in previous labs. </p>
